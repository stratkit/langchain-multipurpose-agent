# 🧠 LangChain Multipurpose Agent

This project is an experiment in building a flexible, multi-tool AI agent using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). It connects a dataset with external tools and APIs, enabling the agent to:

- Analyze data from CSV files
- Call useful APIs (like weather or email services)
- Coordinate between tools based on user input

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Showcase how LangChain enables intelligent routing between tools
- Prototype an agent that goes beyond chat — one that *does* things
- Lay the foundation for future multi-agent collaboration
